MAC (Message Authentication Code): MAC is utilized to check the authenticity 
and integrity of a given message. MAC is an abstract concept of computing
a code that combines the shared key and the message to construct a basis
that the receiving party can use to check the code has not been tampered with,
and that the sender was in fact the one that sent the message. 
A typical way of computing a MAC is by using a hash function.

Consider the following example: A and B share a key. A sends the message 
alongisde a MAC(Key, message). B will compute MAC(key, message) once he
receives both. If they match, then B knows that A sent it as he is the only
other person who knows the key. If either the message gets tampered with or
the key is wrong (different MAC), then B knows the message has been tampered with

Digital Signature: Digital signatures are utilized in order to provide
authenticity of a message. Digital signatures are an application 
of Public-key cryptography, and allow receiver to ensure the intended sender 
is the one that sent a given message. 

Consider the following example. A has a public key everyone knows, and a 
private key only he knows. A computes a signature using his private key and 
sends it to B. If an attacker tries to modify the message, he will be unable to
replicate signature. This allows B to have the guarantee that A sent the message.
